# Day - 02

On day2 we used VPR(Versitle Place and Route) 

VPR takes, as input, a description of an FPGA architecture along with a technology-mapped user circuit.
It then performs packing, placement, and routing to map the circuit onto the FPGA. The output of VPR includes the FPGA configuration needed to implement the circuit and statistics about the final mapped design (eg. critical path delay, area, etc).
